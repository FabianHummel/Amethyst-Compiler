## Introduction

Datapacks are Minecraft's way of scripting custom logic and content into the game. They are written in Mojang's own language MCFunction (or MCF in short) which happens to be a very verbose and unconventional language. Amethyst tries to solve this problem by providing a modern, refreshing way of writing Minecraft datapacks through high-level syntax and perfect integration with the game.
