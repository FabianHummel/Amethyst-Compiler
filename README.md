# The Amethyst Compiler Platform <br>
> A modern, refreshing way of writing Minecraft datapacks

## Introduction

Datapacks are Minecraft's way of scripting custom logic and content into the game. They are written in Mojang's own language MCFunction (or MCF in short) which happens to be a very verbose and limited language. Amethyst tries to solve this problem by providing a modern, refreshing way of writing Minecraft datapacks through high-level syntax and perfect integration with the game.

## Features

Like many modern programming languages, Amethyst abstracts away the low-level details of MCF, and instead provides readable and expressive syntax. To get a glimpse of what an Amethyst code snipped could look like, here's a simple example:

```amethyst
initializing function init() {
    
}

ticking function tick() {
    
}
```

## Batteries Included

Amethyst is not just for writing datapack code, but is also great for managing all resource pack needs.

## Usage

The project structure is as simple as it gets, no need for complicated setups or configurations. Just write your Amethyst code in the `src` directory and run the compiler. The output will be a fully functional datapack. Examples can be found in the `Examples` directory of this repository.

```text
amethyst.toml
src/
    *.amy
```

## Configuration

The `amethyst.toml` file is used to configure the compiler. It allows you to specify the output directory, the namespace, and other settings. Here's an example of a `amethyst.toml` file:

```toml
namespace = "my_datapack"
description = "My first Amethyst datapack"
pack_format = 18
output = "out"
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or bug reports, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. A few things to keep in mind when contributing:

- Language features are defined in the AstModel.txt file and use a proprietary syntax. This file is used to generate the parser and the AST. If you want to add a new feature, make sure to update the AstModel.txt file and run the roslyn source generator to update the parser and the AST.
- Tokenization happens in the `Lexer` class. If you want to add a new token, add it to the `TokenType` enum and don't forget to update the keyword list and / or the `ScanToken` method.
- Parsing happens in the `Parser` class. If you want to add a new language feature, think about how it will be represented in the AST by adjusting the [AST reference](#reference) below and then update methods in the class to handle the new feature.
- Code Generation happens in the `Compiler` class. Changes in the AST will force you to update the `Compile` method to convert the AST to valid MCF code. Note that values represented through variables (scoreboard or storage) are always placed into an intermediate spot `_out` before being used in the final command. This is to avoid complex and repetitive code with nested commands at the cost of a few extra commands (and performance ðŸ˜”).

## Reference

Below is the AST reference for Amethyst. It is a work in progress and will be updated as the language evolves. The schema is inspired by [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
