# The Amethyst Compiler Platform <br>
> A modern, refreshing way of writing Minecraft datapacks

## Introduction

Datapacks are Minecraft's way of scripting custom logic and content into the game. They are written in Mojang's own language MCFunction (or MCF in short) which happens to be a very verbose and limited language. Amethyst tries to solve this problem by providing a modern, refreshing way of writing Minecraft datapacks through high-level syntax and perfect integration with the game.

## Features

Like many modern programming languages, Amethyst abstracts away the low-level details of MCF, and instead provides readable and expressive syntax. To get a glimpse of what an Amethyst code snipped could look like, here's a simple example:

```amethyst
function main() {
    say("Hello, world!");
}
```
