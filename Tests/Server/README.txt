# How to set up the recommended (local) configuration:

- Place server.jar in the same directory as this script
- Place eula.txt in the same directory as this script and set `eula=true`
- Don't modify the server.properties file, it will be generated automatically
- Correct the path to the server.jar in the `appsettings.json` file (preferably just `server.jar`)
- Run the unit tests and make sure all tests pass
